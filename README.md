# # An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.

# # Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the

# # commit message, followed by the description of the commit

# # message's source. The hook's purpose is to edit the commit

# # message file. If the hook fails with a non-zero status,

# # the commit is aborted.

#

# # To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".

# # This hook includes three examples. The first one removes the

# # "# Please enter the commit message..." help message.

#

# # The second includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"

# # into the message, just before the "git status" output. It is

# # commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed

# # commits.

#

# # The third example adds a Signed-off-by line to the message, that can

# # still be edited. This is rarely a good idea.
